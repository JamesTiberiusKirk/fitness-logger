Abstract

This project is a tool to let people be able to log and track
workouts overtime easily from their phone in a flexible
yet complete way. The initial purpose was to make a
phone application which can be used across different disciplines of sport and with different workout types. This
was done by breaking up the data in different manageable units so that the use can create their own workflow
for logging workouts.

However, this was not the main appeal of this project.
The main appeal of this project was the backend implementation. This is because as a part of the architecture design process, it was decided that a micro-services
structure would be followed. This was done for a multitude of reasons, including as a learning experience for
this kind of backend architecture.
