Service meshes and Linkerd specifically seems to be nice and really useful. However, at the moment I will not be using it because I have not even started to use Kubernates. The nice part is that all of this is just setting up the proxies on the k8s cluster and no need to do anything in code. I will definitely be coming back to this at a later stage.

My next step will be to look into Kubernates, just not sure if I should do that before or after I have code running.
