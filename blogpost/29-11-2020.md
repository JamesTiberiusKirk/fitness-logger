# First Entry - 29th of November 2020

Today I am finally getting started with development. So far it will just be getting familiar with using some of the technologies that I will be using. Today it's kafka.

I have started by locally deploying a kafka stack on my local machine using docker-compose with Zookeeper and using Conduktor as a gui client for kafka.

## Notes to self
Found out that when I'm trying to produce and consume data, I need to treat them as strings or arrays of strings. If I'm producing them as arrays of strings, they will need to be added in as separate messages.
